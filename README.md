## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I took on this project after spending a bunch of time learning and applying HTML/CSS basics. Since this project is similar to some previous ones I had worked on, I decided to get some more practice with CSS grids, as I had not used that feature so far for making layouts, particularly responsive web layouts. While I am new to the web world, it keeps amazing me just how much easier it seems both flexbox and grids have made life for designers/developers. I can imagine how frustrating it must have been to make a basic page to be responsive before these features existed. 

Also, this was a good opportunity to get into using version control with git and GitHub. I had ran into them earlier, but couldn't make heads nor tails of either until I had to sit down and learn them with the intent of applying them here. Seems like a great way to do things, and, again, relieving a lot of frustration and panic if/when you want to go back to a previous version of the project.

Finally, deploying the page with a service, such as Netlify in this case, was also something I had done before but only once, so this gave me a good brush-up on the whole process.

### Continued development

It appears that there's always deeper one can go with CSS or any technology/language the more you get into it. Definitely would like to get more comfortable using flexbox and grids, as they just seem to make life much easier and allow you to quickely dish out a working, responsive page/ui. I'm still trying to get my head wrapped around transitions in CSS, which I was experimenting with a bit here, but ended up not using, partly because of unexpected behaviour that I can't properly troubleshoot yet. 

### Useful resources

- https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/basic-git-commands - This git cheatsheet seems pretty handy for quickly looking up the basic git commands and more.
- https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk - Solid tutorial explaining all the basic concepts of git and how to set it up.
- https://youtu.be/lV5mrUYsucU - Solved an issue I had where I was being denied access while trying to clone a repository I'd created on GitHub. I was trying to use the SSH method first, wouldn't work, so I switched to HTTPS while following along with this video. This was all done in the terminal using git commands.
